Here is just one tip of the iceberg we'll explore in this book: How much time does it take to nd the
prime factors of a 1,000-digit integer? The facts are that (1) we can't even roughly estimate the answer: it
could be less than a second or more than a million years, and (2) practically all electronic commerce and
Internet security systems in existence today rest on the belief that it takes more than a million years!

“The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite and of resolving
the latter into their prime factors is … one of the most important and useful
in arithmetic … Nevertheless we must confess that all methods … are either
restricted to very special cases or are so laborious … they try the patience of
even the practiced calculator … and do not apply at all to larger numbers.”,
Carl Friedrich Gauss, 1798
